# DatabaseDesign-SQL-Query

##About Datasets
Datasets used in this project can be found on The National Household Travel Survey(NHTS) and The U.S. Energy Information Administration(EIA) websites.

##Database Design and Coding in Python
The first part of this project involves creating database schema for the NHTS and EIA data. 
Then a program written in python is used to manipulate the NHTS and EIA data and load the data into a PostgreSQL based on the designed schema. Code can be found in DataLoading.py.
The second python program named DataAnalysis.py invokes PostgreSQL to do corresponding computations.
Questions answered by SQL queries can be found in Questions.pdf.
